# Test-Database-Cloud-Server
This project was completed as part of my AWS Academy lab to design, configure, and test a cloud-based database using Amazon RDS and MySQL. The goal was to build a reliable database server, connect it to a web application, and verify functionality through live testing.

This was my favorite Cloud Computing lab because I was also taking an SQL and Database Concepts course at the same time. It gave me the opportunity to connect what I learned in both courses by building the actual server that the database operates on and testing it in the cloud.

What I Did
* Deployed a MySQL Database Engine in Amazon RDS.
* Configured availability zones, storage, and network connectivity for high availability and performance.
* Executed SQL commands to initialize and open the database in MySQL.
* Tested functionality by adding and editing contact records through the connected web app interface.
Key Skills Demonstrated
* AWS RDS configuration and management
* MySQL database setup and connectivity
* Cloud resource configuration
* Application-to-database integration testing
  
Outcome
Successfully deployed and tested a fully functional cloud database environment on AWS, confirming communication between the web application and MySQL server.
